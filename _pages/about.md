> *" I connect **Humans** with **Computers** through novel **Physical Interaction** techniques!! "*

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ This is **[Kyunghwan](https://kyunghwan.xyz/)**, a Master's student in **[School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/)**, **[KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/)**.
I am part of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (**[HCIL](https://hcil.kaist.ac.kr/)**), advised by Professor **[Geehyuk Lee](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=wBXkmcQAAAAJ)**.

I am highly interested in discovering **novel physical input methods and devices** to better assist **input for AR devices**.

Please refer to my **[CV](https://kyunghwan.xyz/assets/pdf/CV_KyunghwanKim.pdf)** for more information and the various extracurricular activities I have organized, including **GDSC** *(Google Developer Student Clubs)*, two **Toastmasters** clubs *(International Association to Develop Public Speaking Skills)*, **G.OnNaRae** *(GIST Student Ambassador)*, and many more!! ðŸ™Œ
