> *" I connect **Humans** with **Computers** through novel **Physical Interaction** techniques!! "*

Hi! 👋 This is **Kyunghwan**, a Master's student in **[School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/)**, **[KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/)**.
I am part of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (**[HCIL](https://hcil.kaist.ac.kr/)**), advised by professor **[Geehyuk Lee](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=wBXkmcQAAAAJ)**.

My research interests lie in **Human‐Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Physical Interaction Techniques**, eXtended Reality (XR), and Assistive Technology.

For more detailed information and various extracurricular activities about me, including GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs), Toastmasters, and G.OnNaRae, please refer to my **[CV](https://kyunghwan.xyz/assets/pdf/CV_KyunghwanKim.pdf)**!! 🙌
