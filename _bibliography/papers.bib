abstract = {Smart glasses have not favored two-dimensional (2D) GUI. Such a trend may have originated from the limitations of smart glasses in display and input devices. While the display restriction is rapidly being resolved nowadays, 1D GUI is still the majority, indicating that the touch input device is the possible bottleneck. To tackle this issue by expanding the vertical input space of the temple touchpad, we propose the Virtual Rolling Temple (VRT). The concept is to perform 2D gestures by moving the hand in any direction while keep touching the prototype as if the temple rotates. The VRT touchpad is as thin as the spectacles’ temples, but it provides the users with input space approximately equivalent to an 80×80 mm square touchpad. This is 8 and 13.9 times larger than Google Glass and VUZIX M400, respectively. To validate the concept of the VRT, we constructed three demo scenarios: 2D Pointing, 2D Menu, and 2D Gesture, to cover different types of general 2D input for smart glasses.},

abstract = {Redirected walking (RDW) visually manipulates the virtual environment to imperceptibly redirect the walkers to keep them in the tracking area, and offers a larger space than physical space. An attractor is a redirected walking technique that captures the walker's attention and manipulates the walker's trajectory through rotational gain. However, the attractor visually manipulates the walker's virtual environment using a predefined rotational gain, and having to constantly gaze at the attractor or the attractor frequently appearing until the walker's direction matches the desired direction, are problems limiting the application of visual attractors. Moreover, when the walker is unable to recognize or ignores the attractor, reorientation fails. In this study, we designed a human-sense-stimulating attractor that utilizes the auditory and olfactory senses to improve the rotational gain, naturalness, and immersion and decrease the chance of reorientation failure. Although sound and scents are invisible, they can be detected through direction; however, humans cannot recognize the accurate direction of a sound or scent. Based on these characteristics, auditory and olfactory attractors are proposed. We measured the amount of reorientation induced by the auditory and olfactory attractors and calculated the reorientation success rate. Additionally, the naturalness and immersion of the attractor were evaluated. The auditory attractor has a high reorientation success rate, naturalness, and immersion. The olfactory attractor induces more turn changes in the walker than other attractors, and a high number of turn changes leads to a larger rotational gain. Auditory and olfactory-based attractors have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of visual attractors such as the frequent interventions.},
